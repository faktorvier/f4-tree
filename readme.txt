This plugin adds a neat and easy to use sidebar tree view to your posts and pages backend.

== Description ==

This plugin adds a neat and easy to use **sidebar tree view** to your **posts and/or pages backend**.

Once activated, your posts/pages will be displayed **hierarchically** in the tree sidebar.

The sidebar appears on every post related page in WordPress, so you don't have to leave your current page to manage or sort the posts/pages.

For every **post status** there is a **icon color**, so you can see if a post/page is published, draft or planned.

You can also see if **someone else is currently editing a post**. In this case a small **lock-icon** appears in the tree.

This Plugin is currently not compatible with Multisites. This feature will be added in the near future.

= Usage =

This plugin works out-of-the-box. By default, the tree will be displayed for both pages and posts. You can enable/disable the tree for both individually on the settings page (Settings -> F4 Post Tree).

= Features overview =

* Tree view sidebar for pages and posts backend
* Hierarchical order and display
* Drag and drop sorting
* Colorful icons for every post status
* Displayed on list view and edit page
* Lock symbol for posts that are currently locked by another user
* Automatically refresh if another user edits a page

= Planned features =

* Context menu for quick actions
* Multisite compatibility
* More tba

= Upcoming PRO version =

We're working on a extended **PRO version** for this plugin, which adds a few neat features:

First of all, it adds support for **custom post types**.

But the most interesting feature is the support for **menus**. With this feature you can **manage and sort the menus you want directly in your tree sidebar**.

That means, you can activate every menu you want to be shown in the tree, so you can drag&drop posts directly at the position you want the post to appear in the menu. You don't have do add/remove/sort posts and pages through the awkward menu page (Display -> Menus).

This feature improves the handling for menus drastic. Your editors and authors will love this!
